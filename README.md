#Tamarin-Tester

This project is a lightwight black box tester for the [Tamarin Prover](https://github.com/tamarin-prover/tamarin-prover)

It aims to support rapid development of the Tamarin Prover by allowing for the quick verification of correctness by comparing development versions of Tamarin to known-good versions.  For now, it simply implements regression testing and will check that verification/falsication of lemmas remains the same and let the user decide about changed step counts.
